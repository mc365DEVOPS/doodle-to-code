In this section, you'll learn about the practical smart bot development with Azure OpenAI On Your Data.

## What is Azure OpenAI On Your Data?

[**Azure OpenAI On Your Data**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data) transforms how you interact with your enterprise data, seamlessly integrates and analyzes your data using advanced AI models, such as GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4, without needing to train or fine-tune models.

You can access Azure OpenAI On Your Data using the web-based interface in the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/), where you can integrate your own data into AI models by simply uploading your datasets.
