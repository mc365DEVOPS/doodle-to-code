## ðŸŒ± Prerequisites

For coding exercises, it is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience. 

To use Azure AI Services, you generally need to have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), which allows you to access and manage various Azure services, including AI tools. 

Additionally, some exercises use a bot on Microsoft Teams as an example. You can start developing on Teams and access the sandbox for free, but first you need to get:
- A [Microsoft 365 account](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with custom app upload permission
- A [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant)
